  <h3> >be me (f21) </h3>
  <h3> >spend a lot of time on Instagram as a teenager </h3>
  <h3> >become overly concerned with my appearance </h3>
  <h3> >but like not my physical appearance, my narrative appearance </h3>
  <h3> >like i want to walk down the street and have people look at me and think "wow she's so mysterious and well dressed i bet she listens to radiohead in a much more esoteric and complex way than everyone else" </h3>
  <h3> >realize that viewing myself in this way makes me feel like shit </h3>
  <h3> >now im in university </h3>
  <h3> >start learning about art and visual culture and stuff </h3>
  <h3> >surprise surprise art oppresses women like what doesnt at this point </h3>
  <h3> >start thinking about the senstation of being observed esp through art </h3>
  <h3> >realize that when people are implicated in a gaze their agency and actions change </h3>
  <h3> >realize that there's a precedent for this in art and cinema studies </h3>
  <h3> >maybe this happens on instagram too </h3>
  <h3> >start critically analyzing a lot of the content i see </h3>
  <h3> >i get a lot of girlblogging content </h3>
  <h3> >start wondering if maybe girls portraying an ideal of themselves that is desperate and sad and helpless is more insidious than it seems </h3>
  <h3> >also start wondering if maybe since instagram is so visual theories about art and looking and oppressive looking can be carried over </h3>
  <h3> >hey maybe this explains why i view myself in a way that makes me feel like shit </h3>
  <h3> >start wondering if there's any connection between all that and the increasingly severe attack on women's rights/the rise in tradwifery and conservatism on social media in the 2020s </h3>
  <h3> >hey maybe this would be a good idea for a paper </h3>
  <h1> tldr i am the cinematic viewer to the movie of my own life yelling at the screen to try and get myself to stop giving into the gaze of the patriarchy ;( </h1>
